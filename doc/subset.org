* Selected Subset of Java 11
  
** Whitelisted Language Features
   
- *Packages*
- *Interfaces*
  Because this is the only way to have multiple parents of a class,
  from which interesting namebinding and disambiguation problems arise.
- *Classes*
  + Fields
  + Methods
- *Bounded generics* on classes and methods
- *Inner classes* (i.e. nested + non-static)
- *Mutually recursive definitions*
- *Casts*
  Because it influences name resolution for inner definitions.
- *New inner class syntax*
  I.e. `A a = new A(); a.new B()` where B is an inner class of A.

** Blacklistes Language Features
   
- *Constructors*
- *Modules*
- *Enum*
- *Interface fields* (because they are always static final)
- *Modifiers* (abstract, final, volatile, transient, private, protected, synchronized, strictfp)
- *Receiver Parameters on method declarations*
- *Arrays*
- *Variable arity paramaters* i.e. `m(Int as...)`
- *Decorators* e.g. @SuppressWarnings
- *Unboxed types*
- *Overriding*
- *Checked exceptions* (throws)
- *Variance annotations*
- *Instance initializers*
- *Erasure*
- *Overloading*
  Because there is an obvious interplay between type-checking and namebinding here.

** Whitelisted Type Checks

- *Multiple paths to same interface is not ambiguous*

** Blacklisted Type Checks
   
- *Definite assignment*
- *Type errors caused by erasure*
